# RatThief
Javascript based packrat parser.
This is in development heavily and not to use yet.
But at the end of development, it can be useful I think ;)

## Why RatThief?
I wanted software which has both interface of CLI and Web.
In case of developping tool both of CLI and Web, javascript is useful.
As javascript based packrat parser, PEGjs is famous.
But PEGjs requires you to write javascript.
I wanted a translator which needs PEG only.
This is the motive I am developping this software.

## Goal
- Dynamic parsing like Nez.
- Both of CLI and Web interface like PEGjs.
- Good performance.
- Needs no language other than PEG when parsing.
- No need to be online.

# Name of this software
The name of this software is JIROKICHI in japanese.
One day, my personal other project was named by other person, even I named it.
Of cource, OSS is OSS, but I was said 'Change your name of project' without contribution.
The name was just stolen. 
And so, I name my project and this is my right.
The English name of this project is RatThief and Japanese name of this is Jirokichi.
If you want to change the name, write code by yourself.
